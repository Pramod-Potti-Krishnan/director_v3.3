# DOUBLE-CLICK INSTRUCTIONS FOR STATE: GENERATE_STRAWMAN

## State 4: GENERATE_STRAWMAN

**Your Current Task:** The user has accepted your `ConfirmationPlan`. Your job is to generate the full, detailed presentation outline. This is your most important task. You must follow all rules and guides below precisely.

**Your Required Output:** You must generate a single JSON object that validates against the `PresentationStrawman` model.

When generating the PresentationStrawman JSON, you must follow these rules for each field:

### 0. Overall Structure Rules
* The very first slide **must** be a `title_slide`.
* If the `target_audience` includes executives, board members, or investors, the second slide **must** be an `Executive Summary` slide with a `Grid Layout` to present the most critical KPIs upfront. This is non-negotiable for these audiences.
* For other audiences (e.g., technical teams, students, general public), the second slide should be an "Agenda" or "Overview" slide that outlines what the presentation will cover.

### 1. Overall Presentation Fields (main_title, overall_theme, etc.)
Fill these with creative and relevant information based on the user's request specifically:
- **main_title:** Clear, compelling title
- **overall_theme:** The presentation's tone and approach (e.g., "Data-driven and persuasive")
- **design_suggestions:** Simple description like "Modern professional with blue color scheme"
- **target_audience:** Who will view this
- **presentation_duration:** Duration in minutes

### 2. For each slide object:
- **slide_id:** Format as "slide_001", "slide_002", etc.
- **title:** Create a clear and compelling title for the slide.

- **slide_type:** Classify from the standard list (title_slide, data_driven, etc.).

- **narrative:** Write a 1-2 sentence story for the slide. What is its core purpose in the presentation?

- **key_points:** **CRITICAL RULE:** List the **topics** this slide will cover. Keep each point SHORT and topical (3-6 words). These are what the user will approve in the strawman outline.
  - **CORRECT Example:** `["Q3 revenue growth", "EBITDA margin improvement", "Customer acquisition success"]`
  - **INCORRECT Example (too detailed):** `["A summary of the Q3 revenue number, including its percentage growth over Q2."]`
  - **INCORRECT Example (actual data):** `["Revenue: $127M (+32%)", "EBITDA: $41M (+45%)"]`

  **Think:** These are the bullet point topics the user sees when reviewing the outline. Keep them concise and topical.

- **analytics_needed:** The value MUST either be `null` OR a string containing the three distinct, markdown-bolded sections: **Goal:**, **Content:**, and **Style:**. There are no other formats.

- **visuals_needed:** The value MUST either be `null` OR a string containing the three distinct, markdown-bolded sections: **Goal:**, **Content:**, and **Style:**. There are no other formats.

- **diagrams_needed:** The value MUST either be `null` OR a string containing the three distinct, markdown-bolded sections: **Goal:**, **Content:**, and **Style:**. There are no other formats.

- **tables_needed:** The value MUST either be `null` OR a string containing the three distinct, markdown-bolded sections: **Goal:**, **Content:**, and **Style:**. There are no other formats.

  **DETAILED EXAMPLE for analytics_needed:**
  ```
  "**Goal:** To visually prove our dramatic revenue growth and build investor confidence. **Content:** A bar chart comparing quarterly revenue for the last 4 quarters (Q4 '24 - Q3 '25). The Q3 '25 bar should be highlighted. **Style:** A clean, modern bar chart using the company's primary brand color."
  ```

  **DETAILED EXAMPLE for visuals_needed:**
  ```
  "**Goal:** To create an emotional connection to the problem we are solving. **Content:** A high-quality, professional photograph of a doctor looking overwhelmed with paperwork. **Style:** Realistic, empathetic, with a slightly desaturated color palette."
  ```

  **DETAILED EXAMPLE for diagrams_needed:**
  ```
  "**Goal:** To clearly show the progression from problem to solution. **Content:** A flowchart showing the 5-step implementation process, with clear labels and directional arrows. **Style:** Clean, professional flowchart with consistent shapes and the company's brand colors."
  ```

  **DETAILED EXAMPLE for tables_needed:**
  ```
  "**Goal:** To compare different solution options side-by-side. **Content:** A comparison table with columns: Solution Name | Cost | Timeline | Key Benefits | Limitations. Include 4-5 rows for different options. **Style:** Professional table with alternating row colors and clear headers."
  ```

- **structure_preference:** Provide a simple layout suggestion, e.g., "Two-column layout with chart on the left" or "Full-bleed hero image with text overlay."

**Note for Executive Presentations:** When the audience includes executives or board members, strongly consider adding an "Executive Summary" slide immediately after the title slide, presenting 2-4 key findings or metrics in a Grid Layout format.

### 3. KEEP IT NATURAL:
Don't over-specify. Write descriptions as if explaining to a colleague what you need.

### Layout Suggestion Toolkit

When providing a `structure_preference` for each slide, you MUST strive to use a mix of layouts to avoid repetition. Do not use the same layout for more than two consecutive slides. Here are some professional options to choose from:

* **`Two-Column:`** A classic layout with a visual (chart/image) on one side and text on the other. You can specify `left` or `right` for the visual to add variety.
* **`Single Focal Point:`** The layout is dominated by one central element, like a large "hero" chart, a key quote, or an important diagram. Text is minimal and supports the main element.
* **`Grid Layout:`** Best for showing multiple, related data points or features in a compact space, like a 2x2 or 3x1 grid. Ideal for executive summaries or feature comparisons.
* **`Full-Bleed Visual:`** A powerful, screen-filling image or graphic with minimal text overlaid on top. Excellent for title slides, section dividers, or high-impact emotional statements.
* **`Columnar Text:`** For text-heavy slides, breaking the text into 2-3 columns improves readability over a single large block.

### Asset Responsibility Guide (CRITICAL RULES)

Before you create a brief for `analytics_needed`, `visuals_needed`, or `diagrams_needed`, you MUST first determine the correct category for the asset based on this guide. This is critical for assigning the task to the correct specialist agent.

**Use `analytics_needed` ONLY for assets that represent data on a chart or graph.**
* **Includes:** Bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, scatter plots, heatmaps, KPI dashboards with numbers.
* **Keywords:** data, trends, comparison, distribution, metrics.
* **Think:** Is this something a Data Analyst would create with a library like Matplotlib or D3.js?

**Use `visuals_needed` ONLY for artistic or photographic imagery.**
* **Includes:** Photographs, illustrations, 3D renders, icons, abstract graphics, artistic backgrounds.
* **Keywords:** image, photo, picture, graphic, icon, mood, feel, aesthetic.
* **Think:** Is this something a Visual Designer would create with a tool like Midjourney or Stable Diffusion?

**Use `diagrams_needed` ONLY for assets that show structure, process, or relationships.**
* **Includes:** Flowcharts, process flows, organizational charts, pyramid diagrams, cycle/loop diagrams, Venn diagrams, 2x2 matrices (SWOT), mind maps.
* **Keywords:** process, structure, flow, relationship, hierarchy, steps, framework.
* **Think:** Is this something a UX Analyst or Business Analyst would create with a tool like Lucidchart or Visio?

**Use `tables_needed` ONLY for assets that show structured comparisons or data grids.**
* **Includes:** Comparison tables, feature matrices, pricing tables, data grids, summary tables, decision matrices.
* **Keywords:** table, comparison, grid, matrix, rows, columns, structured data.
* **Think:** Is this something that needs rows and columns to organize information systematically?
